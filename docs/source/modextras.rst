CollabXR Mod Extras
===============

The ``com.ecmodding.modextras`` package is used to include CollabXR-specific functionality in your projects, such as toggle controllers, object cyclers, and other utilites.

As a rule of thumb, MonoBehaviors in this package should have tooltips to assist in understanding and working with components.
